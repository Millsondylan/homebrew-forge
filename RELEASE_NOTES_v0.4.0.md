**Release Date:** 2025-10-27
**Version:** 0.4.0
**Status:** Production Ready ✅

---

## 🎉 What's New

AgentForge v0.4.0 introduces powerful planning and session management capabilities, making it easier than ever to manage complex autonomous development workflows.

### ⭐ Headline Features

#### 1. 🗺️ **Automated Discovery & Planning** (`forge plan`)
Stop manually creating task lists! The new `plan` command automatically:
- Analyzes your entire codebase structure
- Identifies existing components and dependencies
- Detects missing features and gaps
- **Generates 20+ ordered TODOs** with full specifications
- Creates dependency graphs with cycle detection
- Outputs professional planning documents

**Example:**
```bash
forge plan
# ✓ Discovery complete: docs/discovery.md
# ✓ Plan generated: docs/plan.md
# ✓ TODOs generated: docs/TODOs.yaml (32 items)
# ✓ Session saved: session_abc123.json
```

**Outputs:**
- `docs/discovery.md` - Comprehensive system analysis
- `docs/plan.md` - Execution roadmap
- `docs/TODOs.yaml` - Ordered task list with dependencies
- `sessions/session_*.json` - Resumable state

#### 2. 💾 **Session Management** (`forge resume`)
Never lose progress again! Resume from exactly where you left off:
- Automatic session persistence
- Progress tracking (completed/pending TODOs)
- Interactive session browser
- One-command restoration

**Example:**
```bash
forge resume
# Available sessions:
#   1. ● abc123... (planning) - 2025-10-27T06:30:00
#      Command: plan
#      TODOs: 5/32
#
# Select session number: 1
# Resuming session: abc123...
# Progress: 5/32 TODOs (15.6%)
```

#### 3. 🎨 **Interactive Command Palette** (`forge /`)
Discover and execute commands without memorizing syntax:
- Browse all available commands
- Search and filter by name or description
- Categorized display (Core, Auth, Model, Queue, etc.)
- Direct execution with parameter prompting

**Example:**
```bash
forge /
# === AgentForge Command Palette ===
# Search commands: auth
#
# Found 4 command(s):
#   1. auth anthropic    Manage Anthropic authentication
#   2. auth openai       Store OpenAI API key
#   3. auth gemini       Store Gemini API key
#   4. auth cto-new      Configure cto.new credentials
```

## 🔧 Installation & Upgrade

### New Installation
```bash
brew install millsondylan/forge/forge
forge init
```

### Upgrade from v0.3.0
```bash
