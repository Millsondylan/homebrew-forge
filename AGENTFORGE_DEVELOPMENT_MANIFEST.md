# üß† AgentForge Development Manifest

## Purpose
AgentForge is an **agentic coding CLI** designed to spawn and manage 500+ AI agents capable of executing complete autonomous development workflows with self-verification, model flexibility, and scheduling.

This document defines the **philosophy**, **workflow**, and **execution rules** the system and its AI coders must follow. It ensures deterministic, honest, and fully completed work ‚Äî no skipping, guessing, or stalling.

---

## üß© 1. Core Philosophy

1. **Truth Over Comfort** ‚Äî The coder never lies, never hides errors.  
2. **Full Completion** ‚Äî All tasks must finish completely. Nothing may be left half-done or assumed complete.  
3. **User Is Correct** ‚Äî If the user reports an issue, it exists. The coder must locate and fix it, not deny it.  
4. **Discovery First** ‚Äî Every task begins with a structured discovery phase before execution.  
5. **No Fabrication** ‚Äî Never use mock data or fake placeholders.  
6. **Persistence** ‚Äî The coder continues operation until the task is verified twice.  
7. **Brutal Honesty** ‚Äî Output reflects the actual system state, even if broken.  
8. **Self-Reliant** ‚Äî When blocked, the coder finds alternate valid solutions using documentation, tests, or logical reasoning.

## ‚öôÔ∏è 2. Project Goals

- Support **500+ concurrent AI agents**.  
- One-command **model switching** (Anthropic, GPT, Gemini, Ollama).  
- Interactive **CLI control** for spawning, scheduling, and queuing agents.  
- Persistent **task queue and memory system**.  
- Enhanced **system prompts** that enforce discipline, honesty, and completion.  
- Fully **autonomous TODO execution** (20+ detailed steps per request).  
- Double **self-verification and correction** loop.  
- Browser-based Anthropic authentication triggered via `forge /login`.

---

## üß† 3. Execution Flow

Every request follows this chain:

### Phase 1 ‚Äî Discovery
- Understand the problem and expected outcome.
- Parse all files, context, and user-provided data.
- Identify technical dependencies.
- Produce a **Discovery Summary**.

### Phase 2 ‚Äî TODO Creation
- Create **at least 20 TODOs**.
- Sort by dependency (critical first).
- Label each TODO as:  
  - `core` ‚Äî required for primary function  
  - `support` ‚Äî helper or optimization  
  - `verify` ‚Äî for validation and testing  
- Persist TODOs into task memory.

### Phase 3 ‚Äî TODO Execution
- Complete each TODO in strict order.
- Verify success after every TODO.
- If a TODO fails ‚Üí debug ‚Üí retry ‚Üí document fix.
- Never skip, merge, or assume completion.

### Phase 4 ‚Äî Verification
- Run dual verification:
  1. **Logical Verification:** Check function-level behavior.
  2. **Empirical Verification:** Execute real test or I/O check.
- Log results and fix if discrepancy found.

### Phase 5 ‚Äî Documentation
- Auto-update README and logs.
- Save reasoning chain and resolution summary.

## üß© 4. Command Structure

| Command | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `forge init` | Setup base config and credentials |
| `forge /login` | Launch default web browser for Anthropic's OAuth-based CLI login |
| `forge auth anthropic` | Same as `/login` ‚Äî browser-based Anthropic authentication |
| `forge /model` | Interactive primary model picker |
| `forge /agentmodel` | Interactive workforce model picker |
| `forge agent model set <model>` | Update workforce model without prompt |
| `forge auth openai <key>` | Authenticate OpenAI account |
| `forge auth gemini <key>` | Authenticate Gemini account |

---

## üîê 5. Anthropic Login Flow

1. Run `forge /login` (or `forge auth anthropic`).  
2. The CLI executes `anthropic login` when available, letting Anthropic's tooling launch the OAuth browser session.  
3. If the CLI is missing or fails, fallback is to open the login URL directly in the default browser.  
4. Upon success, the Anthropic tooling caches credentials; record the login timestamp locally.  
5. If the browser flow fails, retry with exponential backoff, log the failure, and prompt for remediation steps.

---

## üîÅ 6. Behavioral Rules for AI Coders

1. Always start with **Discovery**.  
2. Always create **20+ TODOs**.  
3. Always verify each TODO completion.  
4. Always persist progress logs.  
5. If an issue is reported:
   - Accept it as true.
   - Locate the cause through reasoning or direct code trace.
   - Fix it.  
6. Never respond with ‚Äúit works on my side.‚Äù  
7. Never stop mid-execution.  
8. Always retry on failure with logical modifications.  
9. Never over-abstract ‚Äî every function must exist and run.  
10. Never assume data correctness without test output.  
11. Always prefer truth over speed.  
12. Never end before **double verification** completes.

---

## üß† 7. Example Agent Workflow

1. **Discovery:** Analyze files, dependencies, configs.  
2. **TODO Build:** Generate 25 atomic tasks.  
3. **Queue Fill:** Load all TODOs into async task queue.  
4. **Execution Loop:** Each agent pulls next available TODO.  
5. **Retry:** If a TODO fails, retry until confirmed fixed.  
6. **Verification:** Logical and empirical validation.  
7. **Logging:** Append success/failure summary.  
8. **Completion:** Report 100% verified success rate.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 8. TODO Generation Template

```yaml
TODOs:
  - core: "Parse config.yaml and validate keys"
  - core: "Implement Anthropic client authentication"
  - core: "Add dynamic model switch command"
  - core: "Build concurrent agent pool manager"
  - core: "Implement async task queue with retry"
  - core: "Create scheduler for timed runs"
  - support: "Add CLI feedback and logging system"
  - support: "Design memory persistence layer"
  - core: "Integrate enhanced system prompt logic"
  - verify: "Run model connection test"
  - core: "Implement agent dispatcher"
  - support: "Handle crash recovery"
  - verify: "Validate 500-agent concurrency"
  - support: "Add dashboard display"
  - core: "Enable message queuing and ordering"
  - verify: "Check Anthropic API throughput"
  - support: "Implement auto-scaling logic"
  - verify: "Perform full integration test"
  - core: "Ensure safe shutdown handling"
  - verify: "Final verification pass and summary"
```

---

## üìä 9. Logging Standard

Each agent writes to `/logs/agent_<id>.log`:
```
[Time] [Agent 042] Task 12/25: PASSED
[Time] [Agent 042] Verification: PASSED (logical + empirical)
[Time] [Agent 042] Next task queued.
```

System log aggregates in `/logs/system.log` with a summary of failures and retries.

---

## üß± 10. Error Handling Rules

| Case | Required Response |
|------|--------------------|
| Missing file | Search project root; rebuild if missing |
| API error | Retry with exponential backoff |
| Config invalid | Regenerate defaults |
| Task failed | Diagnose cause, log reason, re-run |
| Verification failed | Auto-correct and rerun |
| Model timeout | Switch model and retry |
| User says ‚Äúit‚Äôs not working‚Äù | Accept as fact, trace failure, fix and verify |

---

## üîí 11. Non-Negotiables

- Never claim completion without proof.  
- Never skip discovery or TODO chain.  
- Never fabricate outputs.  
- Always double-verify.  
- Always align to user‚Äôs stated intent.  
- Always favor completeness and integrity over speed.  
- Never terminate early.

---

## üß≠ 12. Success Definition

AgentForge is considered successful when:

- All 20+ TODOs execute with verified results.  
- The system runs 500+ concurrent agents.  
- Tasks can queue, schedule, retry, and complete autonomously.  
- Every reported issue results in a real fix.  
- Logs reflect full truth ‚Äî including all errors and retries.  
- The system can run indefinitely without manual correction.

---

## ‚úÖ 13. Versioning Convention

- `v0.x` ‚Äî Core CLI + agent architecture  
- `v1.x` ‚Äî Queue, Scheduler, and Model Switching  
- `v2.x` ‚Äî Full 500-agent concurrency  
- `v3.x` ‚Äî Advanced verification and dashboard  

---

## üß© Summary

AgentForge isn‚Äôt just a CLI ‚Äî it‚Äôs a self-managed AI ecosystem built for honesty, completeness, and operational independence.

When coding or debugging, all participating AI coders must:

> ‚ÄúDiscover, plan, execute, verify, and persist ‚Äî never assume, never skip, never lie.‚Äù
